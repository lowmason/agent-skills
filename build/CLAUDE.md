# Build tooling (`build/`)

This directory holds the repo's lints and commit gates (each `check_*.py`
documents itself in its docstring), the cross-runtime adapter generator, and a
citation-verification pipeline. The root `CLAUDE.md` lists their commands.

The pipeline keeps `recommend-probabilistic-model`'s PML §-refs and pyprobml
notebook links honest, through two gates:

- **Gate A (mechanical)** — `verify_citations.py` checks that every `PML1 §10.4` section number and `notebooks/book1/*.ipynb` path actually resolves against ground truth in `build/.scratch/`.
- **Gate B (adversarial)** — a human/agent reads the cited section to confirm it supports the claim; not automated.

`extract_structure.py` regenerates the ground truth in `build/.scratch/` from **local PDFs** (`~/Documents/Bayesian/Probabilistic Machine Learning/`) via `pdftotext`, plus the pyprobml file tree via `gh`. **`build/.scratch/` is gitignored and must never be committed** — it contains own-use extraction of CC-BY-NC-ND material.

`sync_runtime_assets.py` and `test_runtime_support.py` generate and verify
Codex/Gemini adapters and the cross-runtime installer. Their canonical inputs
are `../agents/*.md` and `../commands/*.md`; never edit `../runtimes/` by hand.
`test_runtime_support.py` also scans the agent-facing text of `../skills/**`
(not READMEs or install guides) against `../install.py`'s `DEPENDENCIES`, so a
skill edit can fail it.
