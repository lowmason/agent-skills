# agent-skills

My personal collection of [agent skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills), primarily for **Claude Code**.

Each skill is a self-contained directory with a `SKILL.md` (plus any `references/` and `scripts/` it needs). Claude Code auto-discovers installed skills and loads one into context when it's relevant to what you're doing — or you can invoke it directly as a slash command.

## Skills

### Mine

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`bayesian-workflow`](bayesian-workflow/) | Opinionated Bayesian modeling workflow with NumPyro (JAX) and ArviZ. Encodes guardrails most agents skip — prior/posterior predictive checks, LOO-PIT calibration, prior-sensitivity checks, 94% HDI, non-centered parameterizations, reproducible PRNGKey seeds — and walks the full loop from formulating a model to reporting results. |
| [`develop-testing-strategy`](develop-testing-strategy/) | Design a test strategy from *invariants* (not coverage %) for web scrapers, Polars pipelines, and NumPyro/PyMC models — recorded fixtures, schema/null/key assertions, determinism, SBC-lite, golden-master parity. |
| [`validate-data`](validate-data/) | QA a dataset or analysis before it ships — schema/integrity, reproducibility, benchmark reconciliation, and methodology/bias checks. Polars-first, tuned to BLS data and as-of/vintage correctness. |
| [`explore-data`](explore-data/) | Profile a new dataset with Polars before analysis — null rates, key uniqueness, distributions, duplicates, quality flags, panel balance. Bundles a reusable `profile.py`. |
| [`tech-debt`](tech-debt/) | Audit, categorize, and prioritize tech debt in research/data codebases; the DELETE-vs-HARDEN triage. Bundles a `scan.sh` sweep for debt signals. |
| [`design-architecture`](design-architecture/) | Author or evaluate Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for data & modeling systems (e.g. NumPyro/JAX vs PyMC, store layout, vintage data model). Bundles an ADR scaffolder. |
| [`bls-data-context`](bls-data-context/) | Canonical reference for the BLS employment/wage programs (QCEW, CES, SAE, JOLTS, BED, OEWS, ECI, ECEC, CPS) — program selector, cross-cutting concepts (jobs-vs-persons, place-of-work, vintage/benchmark, units), reconciliation rules, and nine full per-program references loaded on demand. |

### Adapted from [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) (Jesse Vincent, MIT)

Adapted from Jesse Vincent's superpowers skills — process disciplines for planning, TDD, debugging, code review, and skill authoring. I rewrote cross-skill references from the `superpowers:` plugin namespace to bare skill names, removed unused authoring scaffolding, and dropped the plugin-bootstrap skill so these work as standalone personal skills. Attribution and license: [`NOTICE`](NOTICE) and [`LICENSE-superpowers`](LICENSE-superpowers).

> [!NOTE]
> These overlap with the upstream **superpowers plugin**. If you also run that plugin, these personal copies duplicate it under the same names (bare here vs. the plugin's `superpowers:` namespace) — use one source to avoid redundancy.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`brainstorming`](brainstorming/) | Explore intent, requirements, and design before any creative or build work. |
| [`writing-plans`](writing-plans/) | Turn a spec into a written implementation plan before touching code. |
| [`executing-plans`](executing-plans/) | Execute a written plan in a separate session with review checkpoints. |
| [`subagent-driven-development`](subagent-driven-development/) | Execute plans with independent tasks in the current session. |
| [`dispatching-parallel-agents`](dispatching-parallel-agents/) | Fan out 2+ independent tasks with no shared state. |
| [`test-driven-development`](test-driven-development/) | Write tests before implementation for any feature or bugfix. |
| [`systematic-debugging`](systematic-debugging/) | Diagnose bugs and test failures methodically before proposing fixes. |
| [`verification-before-completion`](verification-before-completion/) | Run verification and confirm output before claiming work is done. |
| [`requesting-code-review`](requesting-code-review/) | Get work reviewed when completing features or before merging. |
| [`receiving-code-review`](receiving-code-review/) | Handle review feedback with rigor instead of blind agreement. |
| [`finishing-a-development-branch`](finishing-a-development-branch/) | Decide how to integrate completed work (merge, PR, or cleanup). |
| [`using-git-worktrees`](using-git-worktrees/) | Create an isolated workspace for feature work. |
| [`writing-skills`](writing-skills/) | Create, edit, and verify agent skills. |

## Installation

These skills install into Claude Code's user-level skills directory, `~/.claude/skills/`, where they're discovered automatically.

First, clone the repo somewhere stable and make sure the skills directory exists:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lowmason/agent-skills.git ~/agent-skills
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
```

Then install whichever skills you want, with **either** of these approaches.

### Symlink (recommended)

A symlink means edits in the repo are picked up live, without restarting Claude Code — ideal if you're tracking updates or hacking on the skill yourself:

```bash
ln -s ~/agent-skills/bayesian-workflow ~/.claude/skills/bayesian-workflow
```

### Copy

A copy gives you a frozen, self-contained install that won't change when the repo does:

```bash
cp -r ~/agent-skills/bayesian-workflow ~/.claude/skills/bayesian-workflow
```

### Project-level install (optional)

To make a skill available only inside one project (and shareable with collaborators via that repo), put it under the project's `.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/`:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills
ln -s ~/agent-skills/bayesian-workflow .claude/skills/bayesian-workflow
```

### Verify

Inside Claude Code, run `/skills` to list discovered skills and confirm yours shows up (along with the level it loaded from). You can also invoke a skill by name, e.g. `/bayesian-workflow`.
