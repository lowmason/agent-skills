## Canonical report artifact

After every full analysis run, generate `report.md` inside a dedicated results folder. Static descriptions are verbatim — copy them as-is. `<placeholders>` are dynamic — fill them in from the actual run.

### Results folder naming

All artifacts for a single analysis go into `<slug>/`, where `<slug>` is a short lowercase-hyphenated descriptor of the analysis (e.g., `churn-logistic`, `school-funding-hierarchical`). Choose the most informative 1–3 word name. When iterating on the same problem, append a version: `churn-logistic-v2/`. To index those versions and rank them, use the track-model-experiments skill.

```python
import os

results_dir = "<slug>"  # e.g., "churn-logistic"
os.makedirs(results_dir, exist_ok=True)
```

### Output structure

```

└── report.md                    # this template, filled in
```

### Figure naming convention

Save figures using these exact names so the report template can reference them statically. The
ArviZ 1.x plotting functions return a `PlotCollection` whose `.savefig(...)` writes the figure.

```python
import numpyro
import arviz as az
import arviz_plots as azp

# Model graph — render_model needs the `graphviz` package and the system `dot` binary.
g = numpyro.render_model(model, model_args=(x,), model_kwargs={"y": y})
g.render(os.path.join(results_dir, "model_graph"), format="png", cleanup=True)

# Trace — pass var_names to focus on parameters (ArviZ 1.x caps the subplot count,
# so a vector Deterministic over `obs` would error). Rank view: az.plot_rank(idata, var_names=...).
pc = az.plot_trace(idata, var_names=["beta", "sigma"])  # adjust to your parameters
pc.savefig(os.path.join(results_dir, "trace.png"))

# Forest
pc = az.plot_forest(idata, var_names=["beta"], combined=True)
pc.savefig(os.path.join(results_dir, "forest.png"))

# Posterior predictive — arviz_plots (az.plot_ppc was removed from the ArviZ 1.x umbrella)
pc = azp.plot_ppc_dist(idata)
pc.savefig(os.path.join(results_dir, "posterior_predictive.png"))
```

For the calibration plots (`azp.plot_ppc_pit` / `azp.plot_loo_pit`), use `pc.savefig(...)` directly —
`scripts/calibration_check.py --save-plots --plot-dir <slug>` does this automatically with the right filenames.

### Report template

Copy this template verbatim into `<slug>/report.md` and fill in the `<placeholders>`. Every paragraph that is not a placeholder is **static** — keep it as-is in every report.

Sections marked **[IF …]** are optional — include them only when the relevant analysis ran. Otherwise omit the entire block (header included).

# <Analysis Title> — Bayesian Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

<2–3 sentences summarizing the key finding with credible intervals and the most important caveat. Lead with the substantive conclusion, not the model. If the audience is non-technical, also translate to natural frequencies (e.g., "roughly 9 in 10 chance the effect is positive").>

## Data and Question

| | |
|---|---|
| Source | <where the data came from> |
| Sample size | <N> |
| Key variables | <comma-separated list with brief descriptions> |
| Question | <one-sentence statement of what we want to learn> |

<Brief description of any notable features: missingness, outliers, grouping structure, or transformations applied before modeling.>

## Model Specification

![Model graph](model_graph.png)

The model graph shows the directed structure of the generative process. Plates indicate replicated structure (e.g., over observations or groups). Shaded nodes are observed; unshaded nodes are latent parameters or hyperparameters with priors.

**Generative story.** <1–3 sentences in plain language describing the assumed data-generating process. What was sampled first, what depended on what, and what was finally observed?>

| Parameter | Prior | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| <param_1> | <e.g., Normal(0, 2.5)> | <e.g., Weakly informative on standardized predictors> |
| <param_2> | <prior> | <justification> |

## Prior Predictive Check

![Prior predictive](prior_predictive.png)

The prior predictive distribution shows the data the model would generate before seeing any observations, using only the priors. Plausible Bayesian models produce prior predictive samples that span — but do not wildly exceed — the range of the observed data. Tightly bunched priors that exclude the observed range indicate priors that are too narrow; priors that produce wildly implausible values (e.g., negative blood pressure, billion-dollar daily revenue) indicate priors that are too wide and should be tightened before sampling.

**Assessment:** <1–3 sentences — do prior predictive samples span the plausible range of the data? Any signs of over-tight or over-wide priors? If priors were revised after this check, note that here.>

## Sampling and Convergence

| Diagnostic | Value | Threshold | Status |
|------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Max R-hat | <e.g., 1.003> | ≤ 1.01 | <✓ / ✗> |
| Min ESS (bulk) | <e.g., 1840> | ≥ 100 × n_chains | <✓ / ✗> |
| Min ESS (tail) | <e.g., 1620> | ≥ 100 × n_chains | <✓ / ✗> |
| Divergences | <e.g., 0> | 0 (or near zero) | <✓ / ✗> |
| Max relative MCSE | <e.g., 0.02 (β₁)> | ≤ 0.05 (≥ 1 stable digit; from `diagnostics.json → precision`) | <✓ / ✗> |

![Trace](trace.png)

Rank-vline trace plots check chain mixing. Well-mixed chains show overlapping rank distributions across chains — the vertical lines (one per chain) sit close to the uniform expectation. Visible separation between chains, monotone drift, or stuck chains indicate non-convergence and the posterior should not be interpreted.

**Assessment:** <1–2 sentences from `check_diagnostics()` convergence section — state whether all diagnostics pass and flag any parameters with R-hat > 1.01, ESS < threshold, or divergences concentrated in their posterior.>

## Posterior

![Forest](forest.png)

The forest plot shows posterior medians (points) and credible intervals (lines) for the parameters of interest. Wide intervals indicate parameters the data are only weakly informative for; narrow intervals concentrated away from zero indicate strong evidence in a direction.

| Parameter | Mean | SD | 94% HDI | P(>0) |
|-----------|------|----|---------|-------|
| <param_1> | <m> | <s> | [<lo>, <hi>] | <prob> |
| <param_2> | <m> | <s> | [<lo>, <hi>] | <prob> |

Round every cell to the parameter's `stable_digits` from `diagnostics.json → precision` — and usually to fewer, since the posterior sd sets the meaningful digits and the MCSE only sets the *stable* ones (see Reporting principles → 6). Interval endpoints are less precise than the mean: before quoting a tail quantile to two digits, check `az.mcse(idata, method="quantile", prob=0.05)` (and `prob=0.95`).

**Substantive interpretation.** <2–4 sentences on what the posteriors mean in domain terms — effect sizes in original units, practical significance, what the posterior probability of direction implies for the question. Avoid frequentist language ("significant", "rejected").>

## Posterior Predictive Check

![Posterior predictive](posterior_predictive.png)

The posterior predictive distribution shows what the fitted model implies the data should look like. A well-fitting model produces replicated samples that closely overlap the observed data across the full range. Systematic discrepancies — the model under-predicts the tails, misses a mode, or over-disperses — indicate model misspecification and should be addressed before drawing conclusions.

**Assessment:** <1–3 sentences — does the posterior predictive cover the observed data? Any systematic miss (under-dispersed, missing tails, missing modes)? If misspecification is visible, state which aspect of the data the model fails to reproduce.>

## Calibration

![PIT ECDF](pit_ecdf.png)

The PIT-ECDF plot tests whether the model's predictive distribution is calibrated — that is, whether stated credible levels match empirical coverage. The empirical CDF of probability integral transform values should fall within the simultaneous confidence bands. Read its *shape*, not a global sign: in the raw PIT ECDF neither miscalibration sits wholly above or below the diagonal — both trace a sign-flipping slope that integrates to ≈0. A predictive that is too narrow runs above the diagonal in the lower half and below it in the upper half; one that is too broad mirrors that. The single-signed reading belongs to the coverage plot below. See [references/model-criticism.md](model-criticism.md).

![Coverage](pit_coverage.png)

The coverage plot tests the same idea in coverage units: it asks whether nominal central credible intervals (50%, 80%, 95%) actually contain the stated fraction of the observed data. A well-calibrated model lies on the diagonal. Here the deviation *is* single-signed, so it reads directly: above → under-confident (intervals wider than they should be); below → over-confident (intervals too narrow).

**Assessment:** <1–2 sentences from `check_diagnostics()` calibration section — well-calibrated, over-confident, or under-confident, with the mean coverage deviation if available.>

## [IF MODEL_COMPARISON] Model Comparison

| Model | ELPD | SE | ΔELPD | Weight |
|-------|------|----|-------|--------|
| <model_a> | <elpd> | <se> | <delta> | <weight> |
| <model_b> | <elpd> | <se> | <delta> | <weight> |

**Assessment:** <1–3 sentences — which model is preferred, by how much, and whether the preference is robust (ΔELPD > 2 × SE) or marginal.>

## [IF SENSITIVITY] Prior Sensitivity

![Prior sensitivity](psense.png)

| Parameter | Prior | Likelihood | Diagnostic |
|-----------|-------|------------|------------|
| <param_1> | <c> | <c> | <Low / Strong prior — justified by …> |

**Assessment:** <1–3 sentences — which parameters are sensitive to prior choice, whether the substantive conclusions depend on those priors, and whether informative priors that flag as sensitive are explicitly justified.>

## Limitations and Threats

This section is mandatory. Rank threats by severity. For each: state the assumption that might be violated, the direction of bias if violated, and what additional data or design would resolve the threat.

2. <threat 2>

## Suggested Next Steps

<Provide 1–5 concrete, actionable steps. Use the output of `scripts/check_diagnostics.py` `suggest_next_steps()` as the starting point; expand with problem-specific context. Don't dump generic advice — tailor it to what this run actually showed.>

### Common "Suggested Next Steps" patterns

Use these as a reference when filling in the final section. The harness in `scripts/check_diagnostics.py` emits these automatically based on what it finds — only override when problem-specific context warrants it.

- All diagnostics healthy, calibration good → "Proceed to interpretation. If decision-stakes warrant, run prior sensitivity (`psense_summary`) and report alongside results."
- Divergences concentrated near a boundary parameter → "Reparameterize the affected parameter as non-centered (`LocScaleReparam`), or replace `HalfCauchy` with `Gamma(2, …)` for scale priors."
- High R-hat with bimodal trace → "Run more draws and use `init_strategy=init_to_median`; consider whether the posterior is genuinely multimodal (label-switching, ordering identifiability)."
- Poor PIT calibration with good convergence → "Likelihood is misspecified — consider StudentT for heavy tails, NegBinomial for overdispersed counts, or hierarchical structure for grouped variation."
- LOO Pareto k > 0.7 for some observations → "Investigate the influential points (often outliers or leverage). Consider a more robust likelihood or refit excluding the worst points to test sensitivity."
- Strong prior sensitivity on a parameter → "Either justify the informative prior with domain knowledge, or widen the prior and refit. Report both runs if the substantive conclusion changes."
- Posterior shows non-identifiability (parameters perfectly correlated) → "Either combine the components or restructure data so they're separately identified — see `references/diagnostics.md` on identifiability."

## Reporting principles

Bayesian results are inherently richer than frequentist results -- use that richness.

1. **Report full posteriors**, not just point estimates, with the HDI (Highest Density Interval) as the default summary. **No interval width is magic — 95% least of all.** Choose the width from the decision context rather than convention, and report several when it matters (e.g. a 50% interval for the typical case alongside 89%/94% for a robust range). The default 94% is deliberately off-95 to signal that the number is a *choice*, not a law of nature; a wider interval isn't "more rigorous," it just trades a tighter claim for more coverage.
2. **Visualize uncertainty**. Every parameter estimate should have a visual representation of its posterior. See [references/visualize.md](visualize.md).
3. **Show the model**. Include a model specification section -- readers should know exactly what was assumed. Use `numpyro.render_model(model, model_args=..., model_kwargs=...)` to visualize the model graph.
4. **Report diagnostics**. Convergence and model criticism results build trust.
5. **Use probability language**, not p-value language. "There is a 94% probability that θ lies in [a, b]" — not "the interval [a, b] is significant."
6. **Round to what the posterior and the Monte Carlo error support** (Gelman et al. 2026, §11.4–11.6). Two separate limits: the posterior *sd* decides how many digits are *meaningful* — a mean of 1.97 with a 90% interval of [0.7, 3.2] is honestly "about 2", or "1 to 3" — and the *MCSE* decides how many are *stable* under a new seed (rounding unit ≳ 2 × MCSE). `diagnostics.json → precision` carries both per parameter as `rel_mcse` and `stable_digits`; `max_rel_mcse_param` is the parameter that limits the whole table. Never print more significant digits than `stable_digits`; usually print fewer. If you want another digit, halving the MCSE costs four times the draws (§11.4) — it is almost always better to report fewer digits or a rounder interval than to run longer. A fixed seed does not make a number reproducible in the sense that matters (§11.7): the test is whether a *different* seed gives the same *reported* digits, and that is exactly what the MCSE check certifies — so a report built from an exploration-sized run (see diagnostics.md → Exploration runs vs. the final run) must say so.

## Presentation template

For slide-based presentations, use this structure:

```
Slide 1: Title + one-sentence finding
Slide 2: The question -- what are we trying to learn?
Slide 3: Data overview (1 figure, minimal text)
Slide 4: Model diagram or generative story (visual, not equations)
Slide 5: Prior predictive check ("Our assumptions produce plausible data")
Slide 6: Key results -- posterior distributions (forest plot or ridgeplot)
Slide 7: Posterior predictive check ("The data could have been credibly produced by the model")
Slide 8: Practical implications -- translate posteriors into decisions
Slide 9: Limitations and next steps
```

**Presentation rules**:
- One idea per slide
- Visualize posteriors, do not just show tables
- Use ridgeplots or forest plots for multiple parameters
- Show uncertainty in predictions (fan charts, spaghetti plots)
- For non-technical audiences: translate credible intervals into natural language ("There is a 5-in-6 chance that the effect is between X and Y")

## Visualization standards

See [references/visualize.md](visualize.md) for the full plot catalog mapped to the Bayesian
workflow. The essentials:

### Parameter posteriors

```python
import arviz as az

# Forest plot (multiple parameters)
az.plot_forest(idata, var_names=["beta"], combined=True)

# Distribution plot (densities for individual parameters)
az.plot_dist(idata, var_names=["beta"])

# Pair plot (correlations between parameters; divergences marked automatically)
az.plot_pair(idata, var_names=["beta", "sigma"])
```

### Predictions with uncertainty

The following are very simple examples (most of the time you will use ArviZ's built-in functions, as well as
work directly with the `InferenceData` object through xarray).
Nevertheless, the following will give you an idea of the *concepts* we're interested in:

```python
# Fan chart for time series predictions
percentiles = [5, 25, 50, 75, 95]
for lo, hi in [(5, 95), (25, 75)]:
    plt.fill_between(
        x,
        np.percentile(preds, lo, axis=0),
        np.percentile(preds, hi, axis=0),
        alpha=0.3,
    )
plt.plot(x, np.percentile(preds, 50, axis=0), color="blue", label="Median")
plt.scatter(x_obs, y_obs, color="black", s=10, label="Observed")

# Spaghetti plot (individual posterior draws)
for i in range(50):
    plt.plot(x, preds[i], alpha=0.05, color="blue")
```

### Calibration plot

Use ArviZ's `plot_ppc_pit` and `plot_loo_pit` ([arviz_plots docs](https://python.arviz.org/projects/plots/en/latest/api/generated/arviz_plots.plot_ppc_pit.html)). Refer to [this guide](https://arviz-devs.github.io/EABM/Chapters/Prior_posterior_predictive_checks.html#coverage) for guidance about coverage interpretation, and across the whole Bayesian workflow in general -- it's a treasure trove!

## Adapting for your audience

The report template above is for a technical audience. When the user mentions a non-technical audience (a boss, a medical board, stakeholders, executives), or says they're new to Bayesian stats, adapt the report:

**For non-technical audiences:**
- Generate a **standalone markdown report file** — not just code with inline comments. The report should be readable on its own, without looking at any code.
- Replace jargon with plain language: "There is roughly a 19-in-20 chance the effect is between X and Y" instead of "94% HDI: [X, Y]"
- Include a **glossary** defining terms like posterior, credible interval, prior, MCMC in everyday language
- Lead with the practical conclusion ("The drug lowers blood pressure by about 10 mmHg"), then support it with the statistical evidence
- Move technical details (convergence diagnostics, model equations) to an appendix
- Use the section "How the Analysis Works (Plain Language)" to explain the generative story as a narrative, not equations

**For Bayesian beginners:**
- Explain *why* each step matters, not just what it does: "We check our assumptions first (prior predictive check) to make sure our model doesn't predict impossible values like negative blood pressure"
- Contrast with frequentist approaches where helpful: "Unlike a p-value, a credible interval directly tells you where the parameter probably lies"
- Define acronyms on first use: "HDI (Highest Density Interval — the narrowest range containing 94% of the plausible values)"

## Common reporting mistakes

1. **Reporting only posterior means**: Always include credible intervals. The uncertainty IS the result.
2. **Using frequentist language**: Avoid "significant", "p < 0.05", "fail to reject". Use "probability", "credible interval", "posterior probability of direction."
3. **Hiding diagnostics**: If convergence was imperfect, say so. If you had to fix divergences, describe how.
4. **Ignoring practical significance**: A posterior that excludes zero is not automatically important. Discuss effect sizes in context.
5. **Not showing prior sensitivity**: Run `psense_summary(idata)` and report the results — especially for policy-relevant or controversial conclusions. Show the sensitivity table, flag any parameters above the threshold, and briefly explain whether the sensitivity affects your conclusions. If you have an intentionally informative prior that flags as sensitive, justify it explicitly rather than hiding the diagnostic. Readers should know which conclusions depend on prior choices and which are robust.
6. **Skipping the generative story**: The model specification should make clear what process is assumed to have generated the data.
